## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Filter job listings based on the categories

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- React
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Local development server 


### What I learned
This is a translation of my first solution using React ! Mainly I practiced dividing the UI into components, using hooks as useState to change parts of the UI and UseContext to easily pass data from component to component without prop drilling.
